# My Little Tools

This is a collection of small scripts I have written and gathered to solve various problems.

## CLI Utilities

* `tosubl` - Open Files in Sublime Text  
   The `subl` command on Linux accepts a filename, but will not read from STDIN; this is a script I found which allows you to pipe text from STDIN to Sublime. It was written by Yang Zhou [https://github.com/fightyz]  
* `sgrax` - The opposite of `xargs`  
   I needed to take a list of arguments and print them one per line on STDOUT, essentially the opposite of `xargs`
